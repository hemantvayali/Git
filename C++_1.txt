/*
 * Write a program that reads each line in a file, 
 * reverses its characters, and writes the resulting
 * line to another file.
 */

 The code BEGINS from here:
 
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <fstream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    // Input file to read
    ifstream inFile("input.txt");

    // Output file to write
    ofstream outFile("output.txt");

    string sRead;

    // Read each line and write it in reverse in output File
    while(getline(inFile,sRead))
        outFile << string(sRead.rbegin(), sRead.rend()) << '\n';

    cout << "\nProgram has executed successfully!";
    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
 
 The code ENDS here!
